# HollowFaith
Hollow Faith is a 2d arcade platformer game developed by 2 students in CITM during the "development of videogames" subject. The first level gives you time to adapt to the mechanics, in the second level those skills will be put to test.

## How to play:

### General
- ESC: Close Game
### Keyboard:
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- W: Climb up
- S: Climb down
- Space: Jump
- Hold Space while in air: hover

*When a crow appears, it means you have no sight of landing. You have to max jump and hover everytime you see this bird.
